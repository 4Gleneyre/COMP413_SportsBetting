Remember this for context: I am building a sports betting app. I'm using firebase firestore/functions + vercel hosting + nextjs frontend. 
You can find the code for the backend functions in the functions folder, and the code for frontend in sports-betting folder.

Here is the database structure: 

This is structure for events document in "events" collection in firebase, each document is named after event id: 

date
"2025-02-04"
(string)

"2025-02-05T00:30:00.000Z"
